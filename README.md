Why I decided to do this project:

In advancing my web development skills, I decided to make this project to delve into React.js. In my learning, I discovered the Scrimba online course, where I found valuable guidance to bring my learning to life. This project reflects my effort to translate theoretical knowledge into practical application.

Throughout this project, I familiarized myself with modern web development technologies, including Vite, JSON, NPM, and reusable components. I also honed my skills in CSS and gained practical experience in managing state within React. These hands-on aspects enriched my project and deepened my understanding of key facets of web development, contributing to a well-rounded skill set.
