Why I decided to do this project:

In advancing my web development skills, I decided to make this project to delve into React.js.

Throughout this project, I familiarized myself with modern web development technologies/concepts, including Vite, JSON, NPM, and reusable components. I also improved my skills in CSS and gained practical experience managing states within React. These hands-on aspects enriched my project and deepened my understanding of web development.
