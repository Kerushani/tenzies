# Tenzies

Tenzies is a dice game where the goal is to get all dice to show the same number.

How to Play:

You start with 10 dice, each showing a random number from 1 to 6.
Click on a die to hold its current value â€” held dice won't roll.
Click the Roll button to re-roll all unheld dice.
Keep rolling and holding dice until all 10 dice show the same number.
